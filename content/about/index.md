    <h1>Why I use R</h1>

I am a huge fan of the [<img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg" width=30px>](https://www.r-project.org/) project, its amazing community and the tools and packages developed by Rstudio. After being a long time base R coder, I recently switched to the `{tidyverse}` for the clarity of its functions, its code readability and beginner friendliness.

I am also an avid users of Rstudio communication oriented packages, `{rmarkdown}` and `{bookdown}` for reports and web documents, `{shiny}` for dashboards and `{blogdown}` for websites. These tools are a game changer in communicating data analysis results in a dynamic and interactive way. They help a lot in making data and stats more fun to work with and more engaging for decision-makers.

    <p>In my free time, I like learning new R skills, web development and web design. I also have a few off line passions, mostly cooking and traveling to forests and nature <i class="fa-solid fa-mountain"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-person-hiking"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-campground"></i></p>
