Hi, I am Gael, I am a forester, data scientist and aspiring web developer. I currently work as a consultant at the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations, where I specialize in monitoring tropical forests and their impact on climate change. My daily work oscillate between data analysis of forest inventory data, training and reporting/communication.

I am a huge fan of the R project, its amazing community and the tools and packages developed by Rstudio. In particular I am on the path to master Rmarkdown and Shiny and incorporate them in my workflows and communications products. I also provide hands-on introductions to R and R training for forestry data analysis. 

In my free time, I am learning or improving R skills and I am also interested in web development and design, cooking and traveling in... your guessed it, forests and nature!
