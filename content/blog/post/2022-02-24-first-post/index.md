<span class="first-letter">H</span>i! This is my first blog post on my first website created with the R `{blogdown}` package. I wanted to have my own website for a long time and I finally had a little free time this January (2022) before going back to work. I am fairly good with [`{rmarkdown}`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [`{bookdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) now is the time to give [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) a try!

I am an advanced R user but only know basic html and css and no javascript at the time of writing this post. `{blogdown}` is an amazing entry point to learn web development and design package could do the heavy lifting and I could focus on the R and Rmarkdown content. But I couldn't stop myself from trying to tweak the default templates and break everything... And I did! So why not use my first post to give a small list of my main findings.



### Big thanks to the R community 

Before diving in the code, I wanted to give a massive shout-out to the R community. I am particularly grateful for all the awesome tools making code and output more fun, easier to grasp and (most importantly) beautiful.

It's hard to compete with Office suites and motivate people to learn coding when:

- they are already familiar with spreadsheets and docs (and all the bad habits that come with them), and 
- basic knowledge of programming language doesn't give much more than very basic and blend illustrations and reports.

Thanks to the Rstudio crew and the larger R community, teaching R and motivating people to learn R with visually pleasing content as become easier, including my own motivation to keep investing my time to learn new ways to use R for making data analysis and products attractive.
